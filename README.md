# Google vs Amazon HR Analytics
Based on the latest 500 tweets extracted from Twitter of the comapany reviews by the employees of Google and Amazon. This is a comparative study of of how the two giants differ based on work-life balance, salary and middle management and, which one beats the other on an overall basis. 

I have made use of text mining approach of converting the text data into corpuses and matrices and term document matrices in order to make text based heirarchical clustering. Furthermore, I have converted the text into bi-grams and tri-grams (which are the most repeated two and three words respectively). Lastly, I have isolated top 15 factors from each set of reviews and made a pyramid (comparison) plot of each set of reviews (pros and cons) for both the companies.
